# investigate_no_show_appt

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil. I will be analyzing this dataset to try and gain some insight into what factors may affect whether or not a patient will show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. I will focus specifically on gender, appointtment day of the week, and whether or not the patient has insurance.

Questions that I will be trying to gain insight on from this dataset are...

Does gender make a person more or less likely to show up for their appointment?

Does the day of the week show a relation to no show appointments?

Does having scholarship affect if a person will show up for their appointment?

Included file:

no_show_appointments.csv - includes data collected from doctors' offices
